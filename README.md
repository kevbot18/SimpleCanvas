simple js canvas library
This is just a simple JS canvas library I created to learn about javascript canvas interaction. It currently supports drawing lines, rectangles, points, and can directly modify the canvas image data. For interaction it has access to the mouse location, relative to the canvas. Currently unsupported is keyboard interaction.
